# Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

### 1️ Next.js App Router

Used for:

* Clean routing
* Shared layouts
* Production-ready structure

---

### 2️ Fake Authentication

Used localStorage token to:

* Simulate authentication
* Protect routes

Tradeoff:
Not production secure (demo purpose only).

---

### 3️ Client-side Pagination

Implemented on frontend because JSONPlaceholder does not provide full pagination logic.

---

### 4️ Theme Persistence

Theme and profile data stored in localStorage for simplicity and speed.

# Accessibility & UX

* Semantic HTML elements
* Keyboard accessible forms
* Visible focus states
* Responsive design
* Loading and error handling

---

# Future Improvements

* Server-side authentication
* Backend-based pagination
* Role-based access control
* Skeleton loaders
* Unit testing

---

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

* Figma-to-code accuracy
* Clean architecture
* API integration
* State management
* Responsive UI
* Scalable folder structure
